I think that the music is the best part of our game. The music is not the background to the game, but rather the game is the background to the music. It’s a pleasure to listen to the soundtrack while playing. The game wouldn’t be the same without this sound. It is our first game, and we are glad we could involve the VP Production team in the project.

As a result, we gained significant communicative and cooperative experience. We’ve always considered music a vital part of games, and now we’re taking it even more seriously.

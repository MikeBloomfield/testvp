It was a real pleasure to work with the team again. The soundtrack turned out to be a blast, exactly what I imagined! The music conveys the feeling of drive and tension, the feeling that you are a drone pilot and your adrenaline is going through the roof. It’s especially cool that we created the soundtrack with almost no edits, so it’s a clear hit right on target.

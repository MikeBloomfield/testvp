The music turned out precisely the way I imagined it. It perfectly fits the concept of the festival, its atmosphere, and mood even though it was challenging for me to formulate what we needed. ðŸ™‚ For the second year in a row, the anthem has been on a team membersâ€™ ringtone, we organized flash mobs and recorded a video about the festival using it.

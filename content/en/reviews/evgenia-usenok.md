On behalf of the team, thank you very much for your work! I see that the audio brand fits in with Reactive Post and that they are in tune. There are our emotions. The right associations are emerging. ☄️

We had a very good collaboration, and audio has become not just a random background but has strengthened our brand’s associations, completed its perception, and added an emotion that is only ours, reactive. You have felt our brand accurately and embodied it in audio.

The style guide is clear and understandable. It’s cool that there are logo options for different content. Thank you so much for detailing everything. I am sure we will do everything right, and the idea will work. I really like the result I’m imagining. Thank you again!

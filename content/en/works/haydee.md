Haydee is a hardcore Metroidvania mixed with a third-person shooter and platformer mechanics.

In this game, you control Haydee, a half-human, half-robot character, searching for her way out of a strange artificial complex full of traps, pain, and despair. No checkpoints, regeneration, or Â«XÂ» to win. All items are hidden, inventory is limited, and death awaits everywhere. What could be better? ðŸ™‚

Many consider the sexy protagonist to be the main feature of the game. However, the Â«cultural shockÂ» will pass in 15 minutes, and youâ€™ll see that the excellent hardcore gameplay is the main reason this game is so awesome.

*Unfortunately, in 2022, we discovered that one of Haydeeâ€™s key developers supported russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Due to his absolutely unacceptable position, we no longer work on this project and do not receive royalties from the soundtrack sales on Steam.* 

*Our team will never cooperate with this developer in the future, and we donate all the funds from the soundtrack monetization on streaming platforms to the needs of the Ukrainian army.*

## Sound concept

For Vlad, the first Â«seriousÂ» game dev project he worked on was Haydee. Already at that time, he clearly understood that the right music creates the right atmosphere.

He analyzed the general concept of the game and the gameplay and decided to emphasize the oppressive sound. The sound could make the hard core of the game stand out even more. The result is an atmospheric mix of electronics and ambient, somewhat reminiscent of the Tangerine Dream.

An interesting fact: the soundtrack is primarily written in Omnisphere. And in the gameâ€™s main theme, there is an electric guitar to add some melodies.

## Challenge

In the game, the main character wanders through a mysterious complex divided into different zones. They differ in color, atmosphere, dangers, and, of course, soundtrack.

The sound of each zone had to reflect its distinctive features and, at the same time, remain in the general style of the entire game soundtrack. Besides, it was important not to allow musical themes to overlap. It was the main challenge of the project.

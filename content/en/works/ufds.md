[¬´Ukrainian Fight Drone Simulator¬ª](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2862860/Ukrainian_Fight_Drone_Simulator/) is the first ultra-realistic FPV combat drone simulator that is available openly and allows you to improve your piloting skills and experience the emotions of modern combat.

Designed for a wide range of users, the Ukrainian Fight Drone Simulator is a must-have for military personnel, future recruits, fans of military simulators, and FPV enthusiasts.

‚ÄúUkrainian Fight Drone Simulator‚Äù has two modes:

- ‚ÄúAcademy‚Äù offers the opportunity to learn to pilot combat drones through training in thrilling missions in real-life combat zones.
- ‚ÄúPlanner‚Äù allows you to create and experiment with your own missions, exploring drone physics, ammo ballistics parameters, and external factors. This mode will be especially useful in preparing for actual combat missions.
To test the simulator, you will need an FPV drone controller.

## Sound concept
The game developer (whom we met during the ["Trash is Fun"](https://vp-production.com/works/trash-is-fun) project) approached us with a clear vision for the future soundtrack. It had to be emotional, immediately grab the user‚Äôs attention, predictably evoke the right feelings, and create the needed associations.

The music had to emphasize the simulator‚Äôs central promise‚Äîthe adrenaline rush of modern combat‚Äîbut also convey a state of concentration, determination, and even a certain calmness.

We also wanted to differentiate the Ukrainian Fight Drone Simulator from sports drone simulators and classic war simulators with this soundtrack.

Obviously, we had to create a soundtrack that would match the target audience‚Äôs preferences. The latter has not only gaming or training experience in the simulators mentioned above but also a particular ‚Äúaudiovisual experience‚Äù formed by numerous drone videos shared on social media by the Ukrainian military.

We conducted an audio analysis of similar content and, based on its results, the project‚Äôs goals, and certain audience insights, developed an audio concept for the Ukrainian Fight Drone Simulator.

It‚Äôs not easy to describe this crazy combination of musical elements in a few words, but we‚Äôll try üôÇ

The main music theme of Ukrainian Fight Drone Simulator genre-wise resembles modern industrial with elements of metalcore and electronic music (including phonk!). However, the menu and gameplay themes are much calmer and closer to the classic ambient.

## Challenge

There were two challenges in this project.

The first was a creative challenge because we worked with a completely new combination of genres and musical elements.

Creating the main theme was fascinating. First, we picked up a fire audio mood board that immediately charged us with creative energy. Then, we experimented a lot, and Vlad (the agency‚Äôs founder and composer of this project) even recorded his first extreme vocals.

The second challenge was a bit more classic and concerned gameplay themes. We had to create them so that the music would not be too monotonous and get boring during long sessions in the simulator.

So, first, we made these tracks dynamic but much less active than the main theme. Second, we added variability to them programmatically with the sound designer from the developer‚Äôs team.

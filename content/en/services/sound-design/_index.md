title: Sound Design 
type: service
quote: Sound is crucial in the production of games and movies. 60% or even 70% of sensations are evoked precisely by sound. At the same time, sound is not only music but also sound effects. Their presence or absence greatly defines the atmosphere of the game.

{{<service_first_section title="If music is an emotion, then sound is primarily a way of transmitting information.">}}
However, this does not mean that all sounds are merely informative. Just like music, even a second-long sound can immensely impact a person's emotions and overall state.

Whether you like it or not, we are physically unable to ignore sounds. A loud or unsettling sound will always make you alert. On the other hand, the familiar sound notification of incoming money (if you have one in your banking app!) will lift your mood.

Moreover, most of the content we consume today is audiovisual media. So sounds don't just enhance any visual. They help people to believe in what's happening on the screen.

We create:

We advise you to learn more about the latter on our [audio branding page](/en/services/audio-branding/) because UX sounds rarely exist outside the product's audio identity system.

{{%service_section title="What is the process like?" %}}

Over the past years, we have developed a clear and compelling cooperation scheme that makes the creative process fast, exciting, and, most importantly, predictable. It allows us to co-create with you a product that your audience will love and remember.

Below, we'll explain the pipeline, which is typical for creating sound design for games. If you're interested in learning more about the process of creating UX sounds for apps, feel free to visit our [audio branding page](/en/services/audio-branding/). 

<br /><br />

{{< details "1" "Getting to know each other"  >}}
We start each project with a virtual meeting, during which we gather basic information about your game and decide on a preliminary list of audio assets that we will need to create. 

We also discuss how the work process will go, as we need to ensure that we are on the same wavelength regarding the overall vision of cooperation.

If you can't share information about the project without an NDA, we will sign the necessary documents beforehand.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "2" "Legal formalities"  >}}
We clarify the project scope and the payments' quantity and order, sign a contract with you, and obtain an advance payment. Learn more about financial and legal matters in our [FAQ](/en/faq).
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "3" "Pre-production"  >}}
This stage is, without exaggeration, the most important in the entire project and, therefore, often the longest. Over the years of work, we learned that without proper preparation, nothing will work out (and there will be a lot of edits, lost time, and nerves).

Of course, the starting point is the brief, thanks to which we learn more details about your game, its main idea, audience, competitors, etc. Most importantly, we determine the tasks and goals of the future sound design of your game.

We also discuss the nuances of the future implementation of sounds in advance and take this information into account when creating the assets.

Next, we conduct research to gather information about the audio codes and clich√©s of your genre, as well as the expectations and preferences of the target audience. Thanks to this, we primarily form an understanding of how the sound design will help you stand out from the crowd.

Having all the necessary information, we create a technical task and start forming [the audio concept](/en/faq/#audio-concept) for your game. We also compile [audio mood boards](/en/faq/#audio-mood-board)to show you the creative vector and establish a shared vision as early as possible..

After the listening party (the clients' favourite part!), we jointly specify the project's creative framework and finalize its audio concept.

{{< details "4" "Production"  >}}
Well, we've finally reached the point where we start working on the audio! 

We most often work on projects where we create not only sound design but also a soundtrack. We always start by creating the main musical theme (or [an audio DNA](/en/faq/#audio-dna), as we usually call it) ‚Äî the basis of your game's future sound. 

This approach allows us to create not just a set of individual audio assets but an effective, harmonious system. You can read more about this process [here](/en/faq).

The actual creation of sound assets goes as follows:

- We create 3-5 sound effects and send them to you for feedback (after sharing a practical methodology for providing it!);
- Together, we approve the overall sound of assets;
- Based on the first pack of sound effects and your comments, we create the next set of assets and send them to you for feedback;
- We approve the sound effects with you or make edits.

This cycle is repeated depending on the number of sound effects packs.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "5" "Project acceptance"  >}}
After all the approvals, we send you the final files. You implement the sound assets into your project and give us access to it so that we can make sure everything sounds right. It's also a good idea to conduct playtests at this stage to check how players perceive the sound design.

If something goes wrong, we make a list of fixes and ensure you can adjust everything correctly.

When everything is ready and sounds good, we sign an acceptance certificate, and you send us the final part of the payment.

We like to follow our partners' progress and are always ready to continue cooperating and adapting new audio to your product. Within the initially developed concept framework, of course. :)

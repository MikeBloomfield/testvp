{{<service_first_section title="The voice is not only the first but also the most emotional of all musical instruments.">}}
Nothing can convey information, the full range of emotions, and the elusive nuances of mood so accurately, and that's why voiceovers should be approached with great responsibility.

A well-set or AI-generated voice is insufficient to convey the needed text. The main goals of voiceovers are to capture and direct the listener's attention, create an atmosphere, bring the characters to life, or communicate brand values. To fulfill those goals, you need trained voice talents.

The right voiceover is what makes people listen and believe what they hear.

{{%service_section title="Voice Base"%}}

Over the years, we have formed a base of voice talents, both actors and vocalists. Each has various languages ​​and accents, timbres, and intonations. You can hear examples of actors’ and singers’ voices in the playlists below.

{{%service_section title="What is the process like?"%}}

Over the past years, we have developed a clear and compelling cooperation scheme that makes the creative process fast, exciting, and, most importantly, predictable. It allows us to co-create with you a product that your audience will love and remember.
<br /><br />
{{< details "1" "Getting to know each other"  >}}
We start each project with a virtual meeting, during which we gather basic information about your project and determine the preliminary scope of the script that you need to voice.  

We also discuss how the work process will go, as we need to ensure that we are on the same wavelength regarding the overall vision of cooperation.

If you can't share information about the project without an NDA, we will sign the necessary documents beforehand.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "2" "Pre-production"  >}}
At this stage, it is essential to have a final script and character descriptions. Based on this information, we select the right actors and show you their demo reels. If necessary, we record test phrases to help you decide on an actor.

You can also describe the effects that need to be added to the recorded voices (radio effect, echo, robot voice, etc.), and we calculate their cost additionally.

Once we fix the scope of work and approve the list of actors, we can proceed to the next stage.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "3" "Legal formalities"  >}}
We clarify the project scope, sign a contract with you, and obtain a full advance payment. Learn more about financial and legal matters in our [FAQ](/en/faq).

After that, we sign a contract with the actors and provide them with the script.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "4" "Production"  >}}
The voice talent sends us a complete record. We check it for compliance with the requirements and, if all sounds good, send it to you. If you feel the actor has not correctly conveyed any intonations or general message, you can make up to two free edits for each line of the script.

After you are satisfied with the actor’s work, we standardly process the audio file. At this stage, we can additionally process the recorded voice and add the desired effects.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "5" "Project acceptance"  >}}
After all approvals, we send you the final files. This moment is the last chance to use free edits.

You implement the files into your project and give us access to it so that we can make sure everything sounds right. If something goes wrong, we make a list of fixes and ensure you can adjust everything correctly.

When everything is ready and sounds good, we sign an acceptance certificate.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "6" "Support"  >}}
We like to follow the progress of our partners and clients. Frequently, after the project is accepted, the work just starts, and we are always ready to continue cooperation.

title: Audio branding
type: service
quote: In today’s world, brands must now treat the sound with the same care and discipline as they do their graphic standards and visual brand-building. If you’re stuck in the visual-only branding world, you are competing with one hand tied behind your back.

{{<service_first_section title="What happens when you combine audio and branding? (Yep, you guessed it)">}}
Audio branding is the process of creating and managing a system of music and sounds that conveys a brand's meaning at every point of contact with the audience.

It is as essential a part of branding as creating a visual identity. But in this case, the main tools are music, sounds, and voice.

Even when you don't think about it, your brand already communicates with your audience through audio. The question is how effectively you manage it. 

After all, you stick to your own fonts and colors, so why not do the same with audio? Because it's the sonic identity that makes people instantly recognize your brand, even if they haven't seen it yet.

We create:

{{<service_what_we_do_list_item title="Аudio strategies for brands" img="/images/services/strategy-icon.svg" >}}
{{<service_what_we_do_list_item title="Аudio logos and jingles" img="/images/services/jingles-icon.svg" >}}

{{<service_what_we_do_list_item title="Other audio touchpoints" img="/images/services/speaker-icon.svg" >}}
{{</service_what_we_do_list>}}

Each audio brand is unique, as the brand itself. Each business has its own needs, and there is no universal formula for the audio brand. Therefore, depending on the brand's tasks and needs, we create a personal audio brand strategy and elements for each project

{{%service_section title="What is the process like?" %}}

Over the past years, we have developed a clear and compelling cooperation scheme that makes the creative process fast, exciting, and, most importantly, predictable. It allows us to co-create with you a product that your audience will love and remember.

<br /><br />

{{< details "1" "Getting to know each other"  >}}
We start each project with a virtual meeting, during which we gather basic information about your game and decide on a preliminary list of audio assets that we will need to create. 

We also discuss how the work process will go, as we need to ensure that we are on the same wavelength regarding the overall vision of cooperation.

If you can't share information about the project without an NDA, we will sign the necessary documents beforehand.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "2" "Legal formalities"  >}}
We clarify the project scope, the payments' quantity, and order, sign a contract with you, and receive an advance payment. Learn more about financial and legal matters in our [FAQ](/en/faq).
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "3" "Pre-production"  >}}
This stage is, without exaggeration, the most important in the entire project and, therefore, often the longest. Over the years of work, we learned that without proper preparation, nothing will work out (and there will be a lot of edits, lost time, and nerves).

Of course, the starting point is the brief, thanks to which we learn more details about your brand, its values, audience, competitors, etc. Most importantly, we define a list of desirable and undesirable associations that your future audio brand should evoke.

Next, we conduct research to gather information about the audio codes and clichés of your niche, as well as the expectations and preferences of the target audience. Thanks to this, we primarily form an understanding of how the audio brand will help you differentiate.

Having all the necessary information, we create a technical task and start forming [the audio concept](/en/faq/#audio-concept). We also compile [audio mood boards](/en/faq#audio-mood-board) to show you the creative vector and establish a shared vision as early as possible.

After the listening party (the clients' favourite part!), we jointly specify the project's creative framework and finalize its audio concept.
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "4" "Production"  >}}
Well, we've finally reached the point where we start working on the audio! 

First, we create a few demos of [the audio DNA](/en/faq#audio-dna) — the basis of your future audio brand. These demos embody the ideas of the audio concept in different ways and help us find the perfect formula for combining various elements that will work for your audience.

Next, we send the demos to you for feedback (after sharing a practical methodology for providing it!) to determine how accurately they capture your brand's values. However, it's the audience who always has the last word.

That's why, if possible, we conduct testing on your clients together with you and, based on the results, decide on the final version of the audio DNA. By the way, this "composition" is part of your internal documentation, an analog of a brand book. That is, it cannot be used directly in brand communication.

And then everything is super easy and quick. Based on the approved audio DNA, we create all the necessary audio adaptations (audio logo, brand track, etc.). We can also test them if required.

When all the audio assets are ready, we create [an audio style guide](/en/faq#audio-style-guide), for you, which contains all the basic rules for using the elements of your audio brand. 
{{< /details  >}}
{{< details "5" "Project acceptance"  >}}
After all the approvals, we send you the final files. You implement the brand audio elements in the needed touchpoints and give us access to them so we can make sure everything sounds right.

If something goes wrong, we make a list of fixes and ensure you can adjust everything correctly.

When everything is ready and sounds good, we sign an acceptance certificate, and you send us the final part of the payment.

{{< details "6" "Support"  >}}
We like to follow our partners' progress and are always ready to continue cooperating and adapting your audio brand to new tasks and challenges.
